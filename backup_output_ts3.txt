=== REED-SOLOMON (RS) SIMULATION ===
[INFO] Encoding data into 6 data + 3 parity fragments...
[INFO] RS Fragments created: 9 total
[INFO] Simulating 1 node failures...
[INFO] Failed nodes: [4]
[INFO] Attempting RS reconstruction...
[SUCCESS] RS reconstruction successful!

=== LOCAL RECONSTRUCTION CODE (LRC) SIMULATION ===
[INFO] Encoding data into 6 data + local/global parity fragments...
[INFO] LRC Fragments created: 10 total
[INFO] Simulating 1 node failures (guaranteed single data failure)...
[INFO] Failed nodes: [0] (data failure at 0)
[INFO] Attempting LRC reconstruction (local repair first)...
[INFO] Single data failure at position 0 (group 0)
[INFO] Local parity at position 6
[SUCCESS] ✓✓✓ LOCAL REPAIR POSSIBLE ✓✓✓
[SUCCESS] ✓ Using ONLY 3 fragments (2 data + 1 local parity)
[SUCCESS] ✓ No GF(256) operations needed!
[SUCCESS] LRC reconstruction successful! (Strategy: LOCAL)
[INFO] Recovered data: We have ceased to be Men,
A generation of weaklings.
